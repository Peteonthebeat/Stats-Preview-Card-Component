    ## My process

    As mentioned in my previous, I do the entire HTML first; this sorta becomes my workflow or something. Next, I add a little reset to and import the fonts to my scss file and begin testing the CSS I have in mind in Chrome Dev Tools.

    ### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
    - Mobile-first workflow

    **Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

    ### What I learned

    — The main things I was happy to exercise were media queries and grid-template-areas.

    — I also found that super cool property:
    filter: invert(10%) sepia(10%) saturate(10000%) hue-rotate(251deg) brightness(45%) contrast(90%);
    which appears to have an actual knob in chrome Devtools; I really dig that.

    ### Continued development

    Basically, I'll purchase the Pro version of FrontEnd mentor and start messing with the more sophisticated challenges.

    ### Useful resources

    - [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp) - It may sound too newbie-ish but learning about the miraculous 'margin: auto' saved me tons of hassle.
